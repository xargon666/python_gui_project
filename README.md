# Python Gui Project

This is a simple CRUD app currently under construction.

I want to create a python app with GUI to give me quick access to a library of text fields for copy/paste. My hope is that using this will be quicker than relying on notepad, and will be useful for completing similar form data.

## Instructions
1. Download everything
2. run the program from cmd with:
```python test.py```

## 🚀 Update 22-OCT-2023 
Basic CRUD functionality is working!
